Project Artemis Financial Vulnerability Assessment Report
Scenario: Artemis Financial sought my assistance in modernizing their operations and improving the security of their web-based software application. During the vulnerability assessment, I identified software security vulnerabilities through manual code review and static testing using the dependency-check plug-in for Maven.

Coding securely is crucial as it protects data, prevents unauthorized access, and upholds the integrity of the application. Addressing software security vulnerabilities mitigates risks and builds trust. Anticipating future threats was challenging yet enlightening, emphasizing the need for proactive security measures, and staying updated with industry best practices.

To enhance security, I employed a multi-layered approach, focusing on authentication, input validation, data encryption, and recommended secure coding practices. In the future, I would utilize manual review, static analysis tools, and dynamic testing like penetration testing to assess vulnerabilities and determine effective mitigation techniques. Thorough testing after code refactoring ensured functionality and security were maintained. I utilized resources like the Vulnerability Assessment Process Flow Diagram, the dependency-check plug-in, and adhered to secure coding practices.

This project showcases my understanding in vulnerability assessments, identification of software security vulnerabilities, and formulation of effective mitigation plans. The vulnerability assessment report demonstrates my analysis and attention to detail. My use of industry-standard tools and adherence to secure coding practices are valuable skills for future assignments and tasks involving software security.
